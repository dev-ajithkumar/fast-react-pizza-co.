2. Clone this repository or download the code snippet.

3. Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

4. Install the project dependencies by running the following command:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

5. Start the development server:

6. The application should now be running locally. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see the pizza menu.

## Application Structure

The code is structured into several React components, each responsible for a specific part of the application. Let's briefly explain each component:

## Components

### App

The `App` component serves as the main container for our application. It renders the `Header`, `Menu`, and `Footer` components.

### Header

The `Header` component displays the restaurant's name, "Fast React Pizza Co."

### Menu

The `Menu` component is responsible for rendering the pizza menu. It uses data from the `pizzaData` array to display information about each pizza, including its name, ingredients, price, and availability.

### Pizza

The `Pizza` component represents an individual pizza item in the menu. It displays the pizza's image, name, ingredients, price, and availability (whether it's sold out or not).

### Footer

The `Footer` component displays information about the restaurant's operating hours. It checks the current time to determine whether the restaurant is open or closed.

### Order

The `Order` component is displayed in the footer and provides information about the restaurant's hours and the option to place an order.

This code snippet provides a foundation for a pizza ordering application. You can further customize and expand the application to include features like ordering functionality and payment processing.
